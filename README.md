Candy Bot is your Discord server's ultimate guardian, equipped with proactive auto-moderation to ensure a secure and enjoyable environment.

## Introduction

Introducing Candy-bot v2! We've enhanced it with new commands and features. Now, you can kick, ban, and timeout users effortlessly. Feeling lazy? Simply reply ".to," and the bot will give the user a default 60-second timeout.

Additionally, you can set an appeal URL using ".set-from <url>," and if a user gets banned, Candy-bot will DM them with Embed components. Earn coins by voting for the bot on top.gg, and once you have 100 coins, you can buy premium.
